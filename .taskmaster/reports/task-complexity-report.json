      "taskTitle": "Project Setup with Vite, React, and Tailwind",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup task into logical groups: 1) Initial Vite and React setup, 2) Tailwind and shadcn/ui configuration, 3) React Router and routing structure implementation, 4) Zustand setup and project folder structure organization.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies but follows standard setup procedures. The complexity comes from integrating several libraries together and ensuring they work properly. The task already has a detailed step-by-step breakdown which can be grouped into logical subtasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Data Models and Mock Services",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the data models and mock services implementation into: 1) Core data model interfaces definition, 2) localStorage utility implementation, 3) Family and User services, 4) Task and Completion services, 5) Streak and Reward services with data persistence and testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires designing a comprehensive data model with multiple related entities and implementing service layers with CRUD operations. The complexity comes from ensuring proper relationships between entities and implementing robust persistence with localStorage. Testing will be critical to ensure data integrity."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create Layout Components and Navigation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the layout and navigation task into: 1) Core layout components (MainLayout, Header, Sidebar), 2) User authentication and PIN entry components, 3) Responsive design implementation with Tailwind, 4) React Router setup with protected routes.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating the foundational UI structure that will be used throughout the application. The complexity comes from implementing responsive layouts, user authentication flows, and ensuring consistent navigation. The protected routes add another layer of complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Dashboard and Family Overview",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the dashboard implementation into: 1) FamilyMemberCard component with task display, 2) Dashboard layout with responsive grid, 3) Task status indicators and filtering system, 4) Family statistics and progress visualization, 5) Streak visualization and empty states.",
      "reasoning": "This is a complex task as it integrates multiple data sources (users, tasks, completions, streaks) and requires sophisticated UI components. The dashboard is a central feature of the application with multiple interactive elements and visualizations that need to work together cohesively."

    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Task Management System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the task management system into: 1) TaskForm for creating and editing tasks, 2) TaskList with filtering and sorting capabilities, 3) Task assignment and frequency settings, 4) Points and allowance configuration, 5) Batch operations implementation, 6) Task templates and optional drag-and-drop functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a complete CRUD system with complex business logic around task frequency, assignments, and points. The UI components need to handle multiple states and user interactions. The batch operations and potential drag-and-drop functionality add significant complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Task Completion and Approval Workflow",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task completion workflow into: 1) Task completion toggle functionality, 2) Pending approvals display for parents, 3) PIN verification system, 4) Approval/rejection with comments, 5) History view and streak updates.",
      "reasoning": "This task implements a multi-step workflow with different user roles and security considerations. The PIN verification adds complexity, as does the need to maintain accurate state across the completion and approval process. The streak updates require careful integration with the existing systems."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Streak and Reward System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the streak and reward system into: 1) Streak calculation service with frequency handling, 2) Reward creation and management components, 3) Progress tracking and visualization, 4) Reward claiming functionality, 5) Milestone celebrations and streak exceptions.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex calculations for streaks based on different task frequencies and completion patterns. The reward system needs to integrate with the streak system while maintaining its own state. The visual feedback and celebrations add another layer of complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Family Points and Activities System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the family points system into: 1) Family-wide task model extensions, 2) Family points display and calculation service, 3) Family activities and goals components, 4) Participation tracking and reward claiming.",
      "reasoning": "This task builds on the existing task system but adds the complexity of family-wide activities and shared goals. The participation tracking requires coordination across multiple users, and the points calculation needs to handle various contribution types."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Allowance System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the allowance system into: 1) Task model extensions for allowance values, 2) Weekly allowance calculation service, 3) Allowance summary and history components, 4) Payment tracking and reporting features.",
      "reasoning": "While building on existing task structures, this system adds financial calculations and tracking. The complexity comes from ensuring accurate calculations across different time periods and maintaining a history of payments. The reporting features add additional complexity."
