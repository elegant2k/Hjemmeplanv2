# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Dashboard and Family Overview
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main dashboard that displays all family members' tasks and status for the day/week, providing a quick overview of who needs to complete which tasks.
# Details:
1. Create FamilyMemberCard component:
```typescript
interface FamilyMemberCardProps {
  user: User;
  tasks: Task[];
  completions: TaskCompletion[];
  streaks: Streak[];
  onTaskToggle: (taskId: string, completed: boolean) => void;
}

const FamilyMemberCard: React.FC<FamilyMemberCardProps> = ({ user, tasks, completions, streaks, onTaskToggle }) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

2. Create Dashboard component with grid layout of FamilyMemberCards
3. Implement task status indicators (color-coded as specified)
4. Create FamilyStats component to show overall family progress
5. Implement QuickActions component for common tasks
6. Add filtering options (today, this week, all)
7. Create streak visualization with 'flame' indicators
8. Implement responsive grid layout (2-4 cards per row based on screen size)
9. Add refresh/sync functionality
10. Implement empty states for new families

# Test Strategy:
1. Test dashboard with various family configurations (1-6 members)
2. Verify correct task status display (completed, pending, awaiting approval)
3. Test responsive layout across device sizes
4. Verify streak calculations display correctly
5. Test task filtering functionality
6. Verify dashboard updates when tasks are completed
7. Test empty states and onboarding experience

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create FamilyMemberCard Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the FamilyMemberCard component that displays a user's tasks, completion status, and streaks.
### Details:
Create a React functional component that accepts the defined FamilyMemberCardProps interface. Implement the card layout with the user's avatar/name, their assigned tasks with checkboxes for completion status, and visual indicators for streaks. Use color coding for task status (e.g., green for completed, yellow for in-progress, red for overdue). Include a responsive design that works well in the dashboard grid.

## 2. Implement Dashboard Layout with Grid System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the main Dashboard component with a responsive grid layout to display FamilyMemberCards.
### Details:
Develop a Dashboard component that uses CSS Grid or Flexbox to create a responsive layout. Implement the grid to show 2-4 FamilyMemberCards per row based on screen size. Add appropriate spacing and styling between cards. Include container components for organizing the dashboard sections. Ensure the layout is responsive and works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

## 3. Create FamilyStats Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a component that displays aggregate statistics and progress for the entire family.
### Details:
Develop a FamilyStats component that calculates and displays metrics such as: total tasks completed today/this week, family completion rate, longest active streaks, and overall family progress. Create visualizations like progress bars or charts to represent the data. Position this component prominently at the top of the dashboard. Include animations for progress indicators to make achievements more engaging.

## 4. Implement Filtering and Time Range Selection [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add controls to filter the dashboard view by time range and other relevant criteria.
### Details:
Create filter controls that allow users to switch between different time views (today, this week, all). Implement the filtering logic to update the displayed tasks and statistics based on the selected time range. Add additional filter options like filtering by task category or priority if applicable. Ensure the filter state is preserved during navigation and page refreshes. Make the filters accessible and easy to use on mobile devices.

## 5. Add QuickActions and Empty States [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement QuickActions for common tasks and create appropriate empty states for new families.
### Details:
Create a QuickActions component that provides shortcuts for common actions like adding new tasks, marking all tasks complete, or refreshing the dashboard. Implement empty states that display helpful guidance when a family has no tasks, no members, or is newly created. Include onboarding tips or wizards in the empty states to help users get started. Add a manual refresh/sync button with appropriate loading indicators. Ensure all actions have proper error handling and success confirmations.
