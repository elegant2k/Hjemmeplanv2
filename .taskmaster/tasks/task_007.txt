# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Streak and Reward System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the streak counting system and configurable rewards based on achievement milestones.
# Details:
1. Create streak calculation service:
```typescript
const calculateStreak = (completions: TaskCompletion[], taskId: string, userId: string) => {
  // Sort completions by date
  const sortedCompletions = completions
    .filter(c => c.taskId === taskId && c.userId === userId && c.status === 'approved')
    .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.completedAt).getTime() - new Date(a.completedAt).getTime());
  
  // Calculate current streak
  let currentStreak = 0;
  let previousDate: Date | null = null;
  
  for (const completion of sortedCompletions) {
    const completionDate = new Date(completion.completedAt);
    
    if (!previousDate) {
      currentStreak = 1;
      previousDate = completionDate;
      continue;
    }
    
    // Check if dates are consecutive based on task frequency
    // Implementation depends on frequency (daily, weekly, etc.)
    
    // If streak broken, exit loop
    if (streakBroken) break;
    
    currentStreak++;
    previousDate = completionDate;
  }
  
  return currentStreak;
};
```

2. Implement RewardForm for creating/editing rewards
3. Create RewardList component to display available rewards
4. Implement RewardProgress component with visual indicators
5. Add RewardClaim functionality when milestones are reached
6. Create streak visualization with flames/badges
7. Implement streak exceptions for holidays/sickness
8. Add milestone celebrations (animations/sounds)
9. Create reward history tracking

# Test Strategy:
1. Test streak calculation with various completion patterns
2. Verify streak breaks correctly when tasks are missed
3. Test reward creation and editing
4. Verify progress tracking toward rewards
5. Test reward claiming functionality
6. Verify streak visualization updates correctly
7. Test holiday/exception handling
8. Verify milestone celebrations trigger appropriately

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Streak Calculation Service [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Complete the streak calculation service to handle different task frequencies and properly track consecutive completions.
### Details:
Extend the existing calculateStreak function to handle different frequency types (daily, weekly, monthly). Implement the streakBroken logic based on the time difference between completions relative to the task frequency. Add functions to reset streaks when appropriate and handle edge cases like timezone differences. Create utility functions for date comparisons that respect the frequency type.
<info added on 2025-06-10T18:22:54.041Z>
## Analysis of Current Implementation

The StreakService is already quite well implemented with the following features:
- Complete CRUD operations for streaks
- Frequency-aware streak calculation (daily, weekly, monthly, once)
- Grace periods for different frequencies (1-5 days depending on type)
- Error handling with custom StreakServiceError
- Statistics calculation (active streaks, longest streak, averages)
- Integration with completionService for approved completions

### Current Issues Identified:

1. **Missing Automatic Streak Updates**: CompletionService approveCompletion() has a comment about updating streaks externally to avoid circular dependency, but no integration exists.

2. **Missing Integration Points**: Streak updates are not triggered when tasks are approved.

3. **No Holiday/Exception Handling**: The service lacks special date handling for holidays/sick days.

4. **Missing Scheduled Updates**: No daily job to check and update streak status.

### Areas that need completion:

1. Create hook for automatic streak updates after task approval
2. Add holiday exception handling
3. Implement streak status checking (daily job simulation)
4. Better integration with UI components
