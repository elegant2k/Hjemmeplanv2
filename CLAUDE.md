# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Familie Todo App v2** - A family task management application built with React and TypeScript, designed to help families organize household tasks, track completion, and manage allowances for children. The app features role-based access (parents vs children), task templates, streak tracking, and a reward system.

## Development Commands

### Core Development
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Task Management (Task Master AI)
```bash
# View current tasks and progress
task-master list

# Show next task to work on
task-master next

# Mark task as complete
task-master set-status --id=X --status=done

# Create new task
task-master create-task

# Show specific task details
task-master show X
```

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3 + shadcn/ui components
- **Routing**: React Router v7 with protected routes
- **State**: Context API (UserContext) + Zustand stores
- **Data**: localStorage-based services (mock backend)
- **Icons**: Mix of emojis and Lucide React icons

### Key Architecture Patterns

#### Service Layer Architecture
The app uses a service layer pattern where data operations are abstracted through services:
- `src/services/` - All data services (family, user, task, completion, streak, reward)
- Mock localStorage-based implementation with Promise-based async APIs
- Services return realistic responses simulating backend behavior

#### Context-Based Authentication
- `UserContext` manages current user, family, and authentication state
- PIN-based authentication for parent users (PIN: "1234")
- Role-based access control throughout the app
- Automatic state persistence via localStorage

#### Component Hierarchy
```
MainLayout
├── Header (with UserSwitcher)
├── Sidebar (navigation)
└── Page Components
    ├── Dashboard (family overview)
    ├── TasksPage (task management)
    ├── RewardsPage (reward system)
    └── AdminPage (protected parent area)
```

## Language and Localization

**All user-facing text must be in Norwegian (Norsk Bokmål)**:
- UI labels, buttons, error messages
- Form validation messages
- Status indicators and notifications
- Template names and descriptions

Use Norwegian naming conventions for variables and functions where it makes sense, but keep technical terms in English.

## Data Models

### Core Entities
- **Family**: Basic family information and settings
- **User**: Family members with roles ('parent' | 'child')
- **Task**: Household tasks with frequency, points, and allowance
- **TaskCompletion**: Two-step completion process (child completes, parent approves)
- **Streak**: Consecutive completion tracking for motivation
- **Reward**: Configurable rewards based on points/streaks

### Key Relationships
- Users belong to Families
- Tasks are assigned to Users
- TaskCompletions link Tasks and Users
- Streaks track User performance on specific Tasks
- Rewards are family-wide with point/allowance costs

## Development Workflow

### Task Master Integration
This project uses Task Master AI for structured development:
1. **Follow task dependencies** - Tasks 1-5 are complete, working on 6-10
2. **Update task status** when completing work
3. **Reference task details** for implementation guidance
4. **Use Norwegian language** for all user-facing features

### Current Progress (50% Complete)
**✅ Completed**: Project setup, data models, layout/navigation, dashboard, task management
**🚧 Next**: Task completion workflow, streak/reward system, family activities, allowance system, admin panel

### Component Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript interfaces from `src/models/`
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns where applicable
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Include role-based access control checks
- Use the established service layer for data operations

### Styling Conventions
- Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind
- Use established color scheme:
  - Green: completed states
  - Blue: active/pending states
  - Yellow: warning/awaiting states
  - Red: error/overdue states
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind scale
- shadcn/ui components for base UI elements

## Code Patterns

### Service Usage Pattern
```typescript
// Always use async/await with services
try {
  const result = await taskService.createTask(taskData)
  // Handle success
} catch (error) {
  // Handle error with user-friendly Norwegian message
}
```

### Context Usage Pattern
```typescript
// Access user context in components
const { currentUser, isParentAuthenticated, authenticateParent } = useUser()

// Role-based rendering
{currentUser?.role === 'parent' && (
  <AdminControls />
)}
```

### Form Validation Pattern
All forms should include:
- Norwegian error messages
- Real-time validation feedback
- Loading states during submission
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate

## File Organization

### Component Structure
- `components/ui/` - shadcn/ui base components
- `components/layout/` - Layout components (Header, Sidebar, etc.)
- `components/` - Feature-specific components
- `pages/` - Route components
- `contexts/` - React contexts
- `services/` - Data service layer
- `models/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `lib/` - Utility functions

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `TaskForm.tsx`)
- Services: camelCase with Service suffix (e.g., `taskService.ts`)
- Types: PascalCase (e.g., `Task`, `User`)
- Files: Match component/service names

## Testing Strategy

While no automated tests are currently implemented, manual testing should cover:
- Role switching between family members
- PIN authentication for parent features
- Task CRUD operations with proper validation
- Responsive design across screen sizes
- LocalStorage data persistence
- Error states and loading indicators

## Known Technical Debt

1. **Icons**: Currently using emojis - should migrate to Lucide React icons for consistency
2. **TypeScript**: Some compilation errors due to verbatimModuleSyntax settings
3. **Testing**: No automated test suite implemented yet
4. **Real Backend**: Services are localStorage-based mocks

## Future Enhancements

Based on Task Master roadmap (Tasks 6-10):
- PIN-based task approval workflow
- Streak calculation and reward system
- Family-wide collaborative tasks
- Allowance tracking and payment system
- Admin panel with data management


- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `@filename` (@filename) to reference files
  - Example: @prisma.mdc for rule references
  - Example: @schema.prisma for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;
  
  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules



# Debugging React Applications

## White Screen/Blank Page Issues

**Problem:** When adding complex imports or state management, the entire page goes blank.

**Root Cause:** Usually one of these import chains is failing:
1. Complex state management imports (Zustand stores)
2. Router configuration with bad component imports
3. Component imports that have errors

**Debugging Strategy:**
1. **Start Simple:** Always test with a basic component first
```tsx
function App() {
  return <div className="p-4">Basic test</div>
}
```

2. **Add Imports Incrementally:** Test each import layer:
```tsx
// Step 1: Test basic component
// Step 2: Add AuthProvider
// Step 3: Add RouterProvider import (not usage)
// Step 4: Add RouterProvider usage
// Step 5: Add complex state management
```

3. **Isolate Router Components:** When router fails, check each imported component:
   - Replace complex components with simple placeholders
   - Test router without state management imports
   - Add back complexity gradually

## State Management Import Errors

**Problem:** Zustand stores or complex state imports break the entire app.

**Solution:** 
- Always create simple placeholder components first
- Test router without state management
- Add state management only after basic routing works

**Example Safe Component Pattern:**
```tsx
// ✅ DO: Start simple
const Dashboard = () => (
  <div className="p-6">
    <h1>Dashboard</h1>
    <p>Content here...</p>
  </div>
)

// ❌ DON'T: Start with complex imports
const Dashboard = () => {
  const { store1 } = useComplexStore()
  const { store2 } = useAnotherStore()
  // ... complex logic
}
```

## Tailwind CSS Setup Issues

**Problem:** CSS framework setup can cause blank pages.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Tailwind v4 has breaking changes - use v3.4 for stability
- Always test basic styling first before complex components
- Use PostCSS method over Vite plugin for reliability

## Router Configuration Debugging - SUCCESSFUL SOLUTION

**What worked in this session:**
1. **Systematic Component Testing:** Tested each router component individually first
2. **Dashboard Issue:** Dashboard was broken due to services imports - had to revert to simple version
3. **Step-by-step Router Activation:**
   - Step 2a-2d: Test each page component individually ✅
   - Step 2e: Test router import ✅  
   - Step 2f: Activate RouterProvider ✅

**Final Working Code:**
```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </AuthProvider>
  )
}
```

**Key Success Factor:** Following incremental testing rules systematically. Services integration should come AFTER basic routing works.

**Key Points:**
- Test router import before RouterProvider usage
- Use simple placeholder components in routes initially
- Add protected routes and complex components only after basic routing works

## Development Workflow

1. **Foundation First:** Get basic React + Tailwind working
2. **Incremental Complexity:** Add one feature at a time
3. **Test Each Layer:** Verify each addition works before moving on
4. **Document Failures:** When something breaks, isolate and fix before continuing

This prevents cascading failures and makes debugging much easier.


# Task Master Development Workflow

This guide outlines the typical process for using Task Master to manage software development projects.

## Primary Interaction: MCP Server vs. CLI

Task Master offers two primary ways to interact:

1.  **MCP Server (Recommended for Integrated Tools)**:
    - For AI agents and integrated development environments (like Cursor), interacting via the **MCP server is the preferred method**.
    - The MCP server exposes Task Master functionality through a set of tools (e.g., `get_tasks`, `add_subtask`).
    - This method offers better performance, structured data exchange, and richer error handling compared to CLI parsing.
    - Refer to @`mcp.mdc` for details on the MCP architecture and available tools.
    - A comprehensive list and description of MCP tools and their corresponding CLI commands can be found in @`taskmaster.mdc`.
    - **Restart the MCP server** if core logic in `scripts/modules` or MCP tool/direct function definitions change.

2.  **`task-master` CLI (For Users & Fallback)**:
    - The global `task-master` command provides a user-friendly interface for direct terminal interaction.
    - It can also serve as a fallback if the MCP server is inaccessible or a specific function isn't exposed via MCP.
    - Install globally with `npm install -g task-master-ai` or use locally via `npx task-master-ai ...`.
    - The CLI commands often mirror the MCP tools (e.g., `task-master list` corresponds to `get_tasks`).
    - Refer to @`taskmaster.mdc` for a detailed command reference.

## Standard Development Workflow Process

-   Start new projects by running `initialize_project` tool / `task-master init` or `parse_prd` / `task-master parse-prd --input='<prd-file.txt>'` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`) to generate initial tasks.json
-   Begin coding sessions with `get_tasks` / `task-master list` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`) to see current tasks, status, and IDs
-   Determine the next task to work on using `next_task` / `task-master next` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`).
-   Analyze task complexity with `analyze_project_complexity` / `task-master analyze-complexity --research` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`) before breaking down tasks
-   Review complexity report using `complexity_report` / `task-master complexity-report` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`).
-   Select tasks based on dependencies (all marked 'done'), priority level, and ID order
-   Clarify tasks by checking task files in tasks/ directory or asking for user input
-   View specific task details using `get_task` / `task-master show <id>` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`) to understand implementation requirements
-   Break down complex tasks using `expand_task` / `task-master expand --id=<id> --force --research` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`) with appropriate flags like `--force` (to replace existing subtasks) and `--research`.
-   Clear existing subtasks if needed using `clear_subtasks` / `task-master clear-subtasks --id=<id>` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`) before regenerating
-   Implement code following task details, dependencies, and project standards
-   Verify tasks according to test strategies before marking as complete (See @`tests.mdc`)
-   Mark completed tasks with `set_task_status` / `task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=done` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`)
-   Update dependent tasks when implementation differs from original plan using `update` / `task-master update --from=<id> --prompt="..."` or `update_task` / `task-master update-task --id=<id> --prompt="..."` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`)
-   Add new tasks discovered during implementation using `add_task` / `task-master add-task --prompt="..." --research` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`).
-   Add new subtasks as needed using `add_subtask` / `task-master add-subtask --parent=<id> --title="..."` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`).
-   Append notes or details to subtasks using `update_subtask` / `task-master update-subtask --id=<subtaskId> --prompt='Add implementation notes here...\nMore details...'` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`).
-   Generate task files with `generate` / `task-master generate` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`) after updating tasks.json
-   Maintain valid dependency structure with `add_dependency`/`remove_dependency` tools or `task-master add-dependency`/`remove-dependency` commands, `validate_dependencies` / `task-master validate-dependencies`, and `fix_dependencies` / `task-master fix-dependencies` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`) when needed
-   Respect dependency chains and task priorities when selecting work
-   Report progress regularly using `get_tasks` / `task-master list`
-   Reorganize tasks as needed using `move_task` / `task-master move --from=<id> --to=<id>` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`) to change task hierarchy or ordering

## Task Complexity Analysis

-   Run `analyze_project_complexity` / `task-master analyze-complexity --research` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`) for comprehensive analysis
-   Review complexity report via `complexity_report` / `task-master complexity-report` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`) for a formatted, readable version.
-   Focus on tasks with highest complexity scores (8-10) for detailed breakdown
-   Use analysis results to determine appropriate subtask allocation
-   Note that reports are automatically used by the `expand_task` tool/command

## Task Breakdown Process

-   Use `expand_task` / `task-master expand --id=<id>`. It automatically uses the complexity report if found, otherwise generates default number of subtasks.
-   Use `--num=<number>` to specify an explicit number of subtasks, overriding defaults or complexity report recommendations.
-   Add `--research` flag to leverage Perplexity AI for research-backed expansion.
-   Add `--force` flag to clear existing subtasks before generating new ones (default is to append).
-   Use `--prompt="<context>"` to provide additional context when needed.
-   Review and adjust generated subtasks as necessary.
-   Use `expand_all` tool or `task-master expand --all` to expand multiple pending tasks at once, respecting flags like `--force` and `--research`.
-   If subtasks need complete replacement (regardless of the `--force` flag on `expand`), clear them first with `clear_subtasks` / `task-master clear-subtasks --id=<id>`.

## Implementation Drift Handling

-   When implementation differs significantly from planned approach
-   When future tasks need modification due to current implementation choices
-   When new dependencies or requirements emerge
-   Use `update` / `task-master update --from=<futureTaskId> --prompt='<explanation>\nUpdate context...' --research` to update multiple future tasks.
-   Use `update_task` / `task-master update-task --id=<taskId> --prompt='<explanation>\nUpdate context...' --research` to update a single specific task.

## Task Status Management

-   Use 'pending' for tasks ready to be worked on
-   Use 'done' for completed and verified tasks
-   Use 'deferred' for postponed tasks
-   Add custom status values as needed for project-specific workflows

## Task Structure Fields

- **id**: Unique identifier for the task (Example: `1`, `1.1`)
- **title**: Brief, descriptive title (Example: `"Initialize Repo"`)
- **description**: Concise summary of what the task involves (Example: `"Create a new repository, set up initial structure."`)
- **status**: Current state of the task (Example: `"pending"`, `"done"`, `"deferred"`)
- **dependencies**: IDs of prerequisite tasks (Example: `[1, 2.1]`)
    - Dependencies are displayed with status indicators (✅ for completed, ⏱️ for pending)
    - This helps quickly identify which prerequisite tasks are blocking work
- **priority**: Importance level (Example: `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"`)
- **details**: In-depth implementation instructions (Example: `"Use GitHub client ID/secret, handle callback, set session token."`) 
- **testStrategy**: Verification approach (Example: `"Deploy and call endpoint to confirm 'Hello World' response."`) 
- **subtasks**: List of smaller, more specific tasks (Example: `[{"id": 1, "title": "Configure OAuth", ...}]`) 
- Refer to task structure details (previously linked to `tasks.mdc`).

## Configuration Management (Updated)

Taskmaster configuration is managed through two main mechanisms:

1.  **`.taskmaster/config.json` File (Primary):**
    *   Located in the project root directory.
    *   Stores most configuration settings: AI model selections (main, research, fallback), parameters (max tokens, temperature), logging level, default subtasks/priority, project name, etc.
    *   **Managed via `task-master models --setup` command.** Do not edit manually unless you know what you are doing.
    *   **View/Set specific models via `task-master models` command or `models` MCP tool.**
    *   Created automatically when you run `task-master models --setup` for the first time.

2.  **Environment Variables (`.env` / `mcp.json`):**
    *   Used **only** for sensitive API keys and specific endpoint URLs.
    *   Place API keys (one per provider) in a `.env` file in the project root for CLI usage.
    *   For MCP/Cursor integration, configure these keys in the `env` section of `.cursor/mcp.json`.
    *   Available keys/variables: See `assets/env.example` or the Configuration section in the command reference (previously linked to `taskmaster.mdc`).

**Important:** Non-API key settings (like model selections, `MAX_TOKENS`, `TASKMASTER_LOG_LEVEL`) are **no longer configured via environment variables**. Use the `task-master models` command (or `--setup` for interactive configuration) or the `models` MCP tool.
**If AI commands FAIL in MCP** verify that the API key for the selected provider is present in the `env` section of `.cursor/mcp.json`.
**If AI commands FAIL in CLI** verify that the API key for the selected provider is present in the `.env` file in the root of the project.

## Determining the Next Task

- Run `next_task` / `task-master next` to show the next task to work on.
- The command identifies tasks with all dependencies satisfied
- Tasks are prioritized by priority level, dependency count, and ID
- The command shows comprehensive task information including:
    - Basic task details and description
    - Implementation details
    - Subtasks (if they exist)
    - Contextual suggested actions
- Recommended before starting any new development work
- Respects your project's dependency structure
- Ensures tasks are completed in the appropriate sequence
- Provides ready-to-use commands for common task actions

## Viewing Specific Task Details

- Run `get_task` / `task-master show <id>` to view a specific task.
- Use dot notation for subtasks: `task-master show 1.2` (shows subtask 2 of task 1)
- Displays comprehensive information similar to the next command, but for a specific task
- For parent tasks, shows all subtasks and their current status
- For subtasks, shows parent task information and relationship
- Provides contextual suggested actions appropriate for the specific task
- Useful for examining task details before implementation or checking status

## Managing Task Dependencies

- Use `add_dependency` / `task-master add-dependency --id=<id> --depends-on=<id>` to add a dependency.
- Use `remove_dependency` / `task-master remove-dependency --id=<id> --depends-on=<id>` to remove a dependency.
- The system prevents circular dependencies and duplicate dependency entries
- Dependencies are checked for existence before being added or removed
- Task files are automatically regenerated after dependency changes
- Dependencies are visualized with status indicators in task listings and files

## Task Reorganization

- Use `move_task` / `task-master move --from=<id> --to=<id>` to move tasks or subtasks within the hierarchy
- This command supports several use cases:
  - Moving a standalone task to become a subtask (e.g., `--from=5 --to=7`)
  - Moving a subtask to become a standalone task (e.g., `--from=5.2 --to=7`) 
  - Moving a subtask to a different parent (e.g., `--from=5.2 --to=7.3`)
  - Reordering subtasks within the same parent (e.g., `--from=5.2 --to=5.4`)
  - Moving a task to a new, non-existent ID position (e.g., `--from=5 --to=25`)
  - Moving multiple tasks at once using comma-separated IDs (e.g., `--from=10,11,12 --to=16,17,18`)
- The system includes validation to prevent data loss:
  - Allows moving to non-existent IDs by creating placeholder tasks
  - Prevents moving to existing task IDs that have content (to avoid overwriting)
  - Validates source tasks exist before attempting to move them
- The system maintains proper parent-child relationships and dependency integrity
- Task files are automatically regenerated after the move operation
- This provides greater flexibility in organizing and refining your task structure as project understanding evolves
- This is especially useful when dealing with potential merge conflicts arising from teams creating tasks on separate branches. Solve these conflicts very easily by moving your tasks and keeping theirs.

## Iterative Subtask Implementation

Once a task has been broken down into subtasks using `expand_task` or similar methods, follow this iterative process for implementation:

1.  **Understand the Goal (Preparation):**
    *   Use `get_task` / `task-master show <subtaskId>` (see @`taskmaster.mdc`) to thoroughly understand the specific goals and requirements of the subtask.

2.  **Initial Exploration & Planning (Iteration 1):**
    *   This is the first attempt at creating a concrete implementation plan.
    *   Explore the codebase to identify the precise files, functions, and even specific lines of code that will need modification.
    *   Determine the intended code changes (diffs) and their locations.
    *   Gather *all* relevant details from this exploration phase.

3.  **Log the Plan:**
    *   Run `update_subtask` / `task-master update-subtask --id=<subtaskId> --prompt='<detailed plan>'`.
    *   Provide the *complete and detailed* findings from the exploration phase in the prompt. Include file paths, line numbers, proposed diffs, reasoning, and any potential challenges identified. Do not omit details. The goal is to create a rich, timestamped log within the subtask's `details`.

4.  **Verify the Plan:**
    *   Run `get_task` / `task-master show <subtaskId>` again to confirm that the detailed implementation plan has been successfully appended to the subtask's details.

5.  **Begin Implementation:**
    *   Set the subtask status using `set_task_status` / `task-master set-status --id=<subtaskId> --status=in-progress`.
    *   Start coding based on the logged plan.

6.  **Refine and Log Progress (Iteration 2+):**
    *   As implementation progresses, you will encounter challenges, discover nuances, or confirm successful approaches.
    *   **Before appending new information**: Briefly review the *existing* details logged in the subtask (using `get_task` or recalling from context) to ensure the update adds fresh insights and avoids redundancy.
    *   **Regularly** use `update_subtask` / `task-master update-subtask --id=<subtaskId> --prompt='<update details>\n- What worked...\n- What didn't work...'` to append new findings.
    *   **Crucially, log:**
        *   What worked ("fundamental truths" discovered).
        *   What didn't work and why (to avoid repeating mistakes).
        *   Specific code snippets or configurations that were successful.
        *   Decisions made, especially if confirmed with user input.
        *   Any deviations from the initial plan and the reasoning.
    *   The objective is to continuously enrich the subtask's details, creating a log of the implementation journey that helps the AI (and human developers) learn, adapt, and avoid repeating errors.

7.  **Review & Update Rules (Post-Implementation):**
    *   Once the implementation for the subtask is functionally complete, review all code changes and the relevant chat history.
    *   Identify any new or modified code patterns, conventions, or best practices established during the implementation.
    *   Create new or update existing rules following internal guidelines (previously linked to `cursor_rules.mdc` and `self_improve.mdc`).

8.  **Mark Task Complete:**
    *   After verifying the implementation and updating any necessary rules, mark the subtask as completed: `set_task_status` / `task-master set-status --id=<subtaskId> --status=done`.

9.  **Commit Changes (If using Git):**
    *   Stage the relevant code changes and any updated/new rule files (`git add .`).
    *   Craft a comprehensive Git commit message summarizing the work done for the subtask, including both code implementation and any rule adjustments.
    *   Execute the commit command directly in the terminal (e.g., `git commit -m 'feat(module): Implement feature X for subtask <subtaskId>\n\n- Details about changes...\n- Updated rule Y for pattern Z'`).
    *   Consider if a Changeset is needed according to internal versioning guidelines (previously linked to `changeset.mdc`). If so, run `npm run changeset`, stage the generated file, and amend the commit or create a new one.

10. **Proceed to Next Subtask:**
    *   Identify the next subtask (e.g., using `next_task` / `task-master next`).

## Code Analysis & Refactoring Techniques

- **Top-Level Function Search**:
    - Useful for understanding module structure or planning refactors.
    - Use grep/ripgrep to find exported functions/constants:
      `rg "export (async function|function|const) \w+"` or similar patterns.
    - Can help compare functions between files during migrations or identify potential naming conflicts.

---
*This workflow provides a general guideline. Adapt it based on your specific project needs and team practices.*

This document provides a detailed reference for interacting with Taskmaster, covering both the recommended MCP tools, suitable for integrations like Cursor, and the corresponding `task-master` CLI commands, designed for direct user interaction or fallback.

**Note:** For interacting with Taskmaster programmatically or via integrated tools, using the **MCP tools is strongly recommended** due to better performance, structured data, and error handling. The CLI commands serve as a user-friendly alternative and fallback. 

**Important:** Several MCP tools involve AI processing... The AI-powered tools include `parse_prd`, `analyze_project_complexity`, `update_subtask`, `update_task`, `update`, `expand_all`, `expand_task`, and `add_task`.

## Initialization & Setup

### 1. Initialize Project (`init`)

*   **MCP Tool:** `initialize_project`
*   **CLI Command:** `task-master init [options]`
*   **Description:** `Set up the basic Taskmaster file structure and configuration in the current directory for a new project.`
*   **Key CLI Options:**
    *   `--name <name>`: `Set the name for your project in Taskmaster's configuration.`
    *   `--description <text>`: `Provide a brief description for your project.`
    *   `--version <version>`: `Set the initial version for your project, e.g., '0.1.0'.`
    *   `-y, --yes`: `Initialize Taskmaster quickly using default settings without interactive prompts.`
*   **Usage:** Run this once at the beginning of a new project.
*   **MCP Variant Description:** `Set up the basic Taskmaster file structure and configuration in the current directory for a new project by running the 'task-master init' command.`
*   **Key MCP Parameters/Options:**
    *   `projectName`: `Set the name for your project.` (CLI: `--name <name>`)
    *   `projectDescription`: `Provide a brief description for your project.` (CLI: `--description <text>`)
    *   `projectVersion`: `Set the initial version for your project, e.g., '0.1.0'.` (CLI: `--version <version>`)
    *   `authorName`: `Author name.` (CLI: `--author <author>`)
    *   `skipInstall`: `Skip installing dependencies. Default is false.` (CLI: `--skip-install`)
    *   `addAliases`: `Add shell aliases tm and taskmaster. Default is false.` (CLI: `--aliases`)
    *   `yes`: `Skip prompts and use defaults/provided arguments. Default is false.` (CLI: `-y, --yes`)
*   **Usage:** Run this once at the beginning of a new project, typically via an integrated tool like Cursor. Operates on the current working directory of the MCP server. 
*   **Important:** Once complete, you *MUST* parse a prd in order to generate tasks. There will be no tasks files until then. The next step after initializing should be to create a PRD using the example PRD in .taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt. 

### 2. Parse PRD (`parse_prd`)

*   **MCP Tool:** `parse_prd`
*   **CLI Command:** `task-master parse-prd [file] [options]`
*   **Description:** `Parse a Product Requirements Document, PRD, or text file with Taskmaster to automatically generate an initial set of tasks in tasks.json.`
*   **Key Parameters/Options:**
    *   `input`: `Path to your PRD or requirements text file that Taskmaster should parse for tasks.` (CLI: `[file]` positional or `-i, --input <file>`)
    *   `output`: `Specify where Taskmaster should save the generated 'tasks.json' file. Defaults to '.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json'.` (CLI: `-o, --output <file>`)
    *   `numTasks`: `Approximate number of top-level tasks Taskmaster should aim to generate from the document.` (CLI: `-n, --num-tasks <number>`)
    *   `force`: `Use this to allow Taskmaster to overwrite an existing 'tasks.json' without asking for confirmation.` (CLI: `-f, --force`)
*   **Usage:** Useful for bootstrapping a project from an existing requirements document.
*   **Notes:** Task Master will strictly adhere to any specific requirements mentioned in the PRD, such as libraries, database schemas, frameworks, tech stacks, etc., while filling in any gaps where the PRD isn't fully specified. Tasks are designed to provide the most direct implementation path while avoiding over-engineering.
*   **Important:** This MCP tool makes AI calls and can take up to a minute to complete. Please inform users to hang tight while the operation is in progress. If the user does not have a PRD, suggest discussing their idea and then use the example PRD in `.taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt` as a template for creating the PRD based on their idea, for use with `parse-prd`.

## AI Model Configuration

### 2. Manage Models (`models`)
*   **MCP Tool:** `models`

    *   `projectRoot <string>`: `Optional. Absolute path to the project root directory.` (CLI: Determined automatically)
*   **Key CLI Options:**
    *   `--set-main <model_id>`: `Set the primary model.`
    *   `--set-research <model_id>`: `Set the research model.`
    *   `--set-fallback <model_id>`: `Set the fallback model.`
    *   `--ollama`: `Specify that the provided model ID is for Ollama (use with --set-*).`
    *   `--openrouter`: `Specify that the provided model ID is for OpenRouter (use with --set-*). Validates against OpenRouter API.`
    *   `--setup`: `Run interactive setup to configure models, including custom Ollama/OpenRouter IDs.`
*   **Usage (MCP):** Call without set flags to get current config. Use `setMain`, `setResearch`, or `setFallback` with a valid model ID to update the configuration. Use `listAvailableModels: true` to get a list of unassigned models. To set a custom model, provide the model ID and set `ollama: true` or `openrouter: true`.
*   **Usage (CLI):** Run without flags to view current configuration and available models. Use set flags to update specific roles. Use `--setup` for guided configuration, including custom models. To set a custom model via flags, use `--set-<role>=<model_id>` along with either `--ollama` or `--openrouter`.
*   **Notes:** Configuration is stored in `.taskmaster/config.json` in the project root. This command/tool modifies that file. Use `listAvailableModels` or `task-master models` to see internally supported models. OpenRouter custom models are validated against their live API. Ollama custom models are not validated live.
*   **API note:** API keys for selected AI providers (based on their model) need to exist in the mcp.json file to be accessible in MCP context. The API keys must be present in the local .env file for the CLI to be able to read them.
*   **Model costs:** The costs in supported models are expressed in dollars. An input/output value of 3 is $3.00. A value of 0.8 is $0.80. 
*   **Warning:** DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT THE .taskmaster/config.json FILE. Use the included commands either in the MCP or CLI format as needed. Always prioritize MCP tools when available and use the CLI as a fallback.

*   **MCP Tool:** `analyze_project_complexity`
*   **CLI Command:** `task-master analyze-complexity [options]`
*   **Description:** `Have Taskmaster analyze your tasks to determine their complexity and suggest which ones need to be broken down further.`
*   **Key Parameters/Options:**
    *   `output`: `Where to save the complexity analysis report (default: '.taskmaster/reports/task-complexity-report.json').` (CLI: `-o, --output <file>`)
    *   `threshold`: `The minimum complexity score (1-10) that should trigger a recommendation to expand a task.` (CLI: `-t, --threshold <number>`)
    *   `research`: `Enable research role for more accurate complexity analysis. Requires appropriate API key.` (CLI: `-r, --research`)
    *   `file`: `Path to your Taskmaster 'tasks.json' file. Default relies on auto-detection.` (CLI: `-f, --file <file>`)
*   **Usage:** Used before breaking down tasks to identify which ones need the most attention.
*   **Important:** This MCP tool makes AI calls and can take up to a minute to complete. Please inform users to hang tight while the operation is in progress.

### 23. View Complexity Report (`complexity_report`)

*   **MCP Tool:** `complexity_report`
*   **CLI Command:** `task-master complexity-report [options]`
*   **Description:** `Display the task complexity analysis report in a readable format.`
*   **Key Parameters/Options:**
    *   `file`: `Path to the complexity report (default: '.taskmaster/reports/task-complexity-report.json').` (CLI: `-f, --file <file>`)
*   **Usage:** Review and understand the complexity analysis results after running analyze-complexity.

## File Management

### 24. Generate Task Files (`generate`)

*   **MCP Tool:** `generate`
*   **CLI Command:** `task-master generate [options]`
*   **Description:** `Create or update individual Markdown files for each task based on your tasks.json.`
*   **Key Parameters/Options:**
    *   `output`: `The directory where Taskmaster should save the task files (default: in a 'tasks' directory).` (CLI: `-o, --output <directory>`)
    *   `file`: `Path to your Taskmaster 'tasks.json' file. Default relies on auto-detection.` (CLI: `-f, --file <file>`)
*   **Usage:** Run this after making changes to tasks.json to keep individual task files up to date.

## Environment Variables Configuration (Updated)

Taskmaster primarily uses the **`.taskmaster/config.json`** file (in project root) for configuration (models, parameters, logging level, etc.), managed via `task-master models --setup`.

Environment variables are used **only** for sensitive API keys related to AI providers and specific overrides like the Ollama base URL:

*   **API Keys (Required for corresponding provider):**
    *   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
    *   `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
    *   `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    *   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
    *   `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
    *   `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` (Requires `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` too)
    *   `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
    *   `XAI_API_KEY`
    *   `OLLAMA_API_KEY` (Requires `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` too)
*   **Endpoints (Optional/Provider Specific inside .taskmaster/config.json):**
    *   `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
    *   `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (Default: `http://localhost:11434/api`)

**Set API keys** in your **`.env`** file in the project root (for CLI use) or within the `env` section of your **`.cursor/mcp.json`** file (for MCP/Cursor integration). All other settings (model choice, max tokens, temperature, log level, custom endpoints) are managed in `.taskmaster/config.json` via `task-master models` command or `models` MCP tool.
